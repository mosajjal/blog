What is it exactly? Dynamic Binary Analysis (DBA) is a technique to analyze the behavior of a binary by somehow running it and watch its behavior. Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of Static Binary Analysis in which you disassemble a piece of code and draw the graph of the entire program to see what it does.
Why not Static? well, it&amp;rsquo;s actually better if you have a small binary or a binary written in a friendly programming language.</description></item></channel></rss>
