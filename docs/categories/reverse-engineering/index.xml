UPDATE: full PoC is now available on Github.
UPDATE: CVE-2018-14847 has been assigned to this vulnerability and there should be a MetaSploit module related to this bug soon.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Dynamic Binary Analysis</title><link>https://blog.n0p.me/2018/03/2018-03-27-dynamic-binary-analysis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 18:18:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://blog.n0p.me/2018/03/2018-03-27-dynamic-binary-analysis/</guid><description>What, Why, and Where? What is it exactly? Dynamic Binary Analysis (DBA) is a technique to analyze the behavior of a binary by somehow running it and watch its behavior. Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of Static Binary Analysis in which you disassemble a piece of code and draw the graph of the entire program to see what it does.
Why not Static? well, it&amp;rsquo;s actually better if you have a small binary or a binary written in a friendly programming language.</description></item></channel></rss>
