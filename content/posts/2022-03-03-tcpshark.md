## Overview

As a cyber defender and a DFIR analyst, network packet captures are one of my best friends .I know that’s probably one of the most depressing things you’ve ever heard, but that doesn’t make it less true(͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖).

Packets don’t lie if they’re stored properly, and they paint a good picture of what happened if there’s enough metadata surrounding it. If you have proper packet processing, you’ve got a powerful toolkit for your IR and 0-day detection kit. When you’re doing IR on a host, it’s always a good idea to turn on a packet capture in the background while you’re responding, recovering or even remediating, since more often than not those packets will come handy as evidence.

Depending on what OS you’re working with at the time, you use a different tool for capturing packet. And that tool, and the way its built, actually matters. Shameless plug: I’ve [built](https://www.github.com/mosajjal/binary-tools) quite a few tools for Linux (both `amd64` and `arm7`-`arm64`) with static linking, so the binary can be run directly w/o any need for a shared library. This (mostly) eliminates the risk of a malicious actor pwning one of your core libraries or even worse, backdoor it.

If you want to see an example of that, look at how `bash` is linked against `readline.so`, meaning each command that you pass through your bash terminal, it gets through `readline` library. so if I go and replace `readline` with a backdoor-ed version, `bash` would have no idea and you’ll have the easiest keylogger in the world. So it’s a bit tricky to SSH into a compromised host and copy your “helper” scripts and tools, hence all of them might get leaked quite easily. To combat this, I just compile them statically and ship my own shell and tools. One of which, is of course, `tcpdump` and `tcpshark`.

## Use cases

You probably have your own copy of `tcpdump` to capture packets. Easy to use, powerful and portable. you’ll go open a `screen`  or `tmux` session on your target, run a `tcpdump` in the background and detach and continue your IR, and when you’re done, you’ll bring that `pcap` file to your system later on for further analysis and as potential evidence. I bet you at least open it once in Wireshark and give a few important glances to the packets and their statistics over there before you potentially give it to another tool to process or maybe even index it.  This is where the limitation of `tcpdump` and other packet capture tools will become apparent.

Let’s say you have DNS packets from localhost to localhost, and then from localhost to 8.8.8.8 with a suspicious TXT query. It’s easy to see it, and it’s easy to potentially categorize it, but one of the questions that you can’t usually answer very well by just looking at the packet is this: which process did this? that becomes even more important, if the data itself is encrypted and the idea of whether the data is send with malicious intent or not, entirely depends on the context. That context usually starts with a “who did this” rather than “what got sent”.

## Technical details

This is where `tcpshark` comes into play. It’s pretty simple actually. `tcpshark` is a `libpcap`-based capture tool, just like `tcpdump`. But it has an extra nifty feature: it captures your `netstat` every second, and correlates the packets real-time against it, so each packet’s PID gets recorded. `tcpshark` can then go and fetch more info on the PID in realtime, such as the command and the `argv` of it from the OS, and paint a full picture of what PID, with what context, is participating in the TCP or UDP connection. The “metadata” for the packet gets saved through a simple `struct`, that follows how packet dissectors work:

So each Ethernet packet, has a hex streams attached to the end of it, which contains the PID, and optionally the cmd and the arguments  (via the -v1 and -v2 tags). Now comes the interesting part. Make that struct parsed in Wireshark, and make it searchable data. So you can go search what did my `curl` process do, and filter that nice and easy in Wireshark.

To do that, first `wireshark`'s awesome custom dissector capability is used. it’s a Lua script with excellent and thorough documentation. It was actually pretty straightforward to cobble something together, since our struct’s look and feel resembled every other network packet I’ve seen, which is a byte or two for the length of the value that comes next, this saves a ton of space and makes it easy to write parsers that don’t overflow easily.

Putting all the small pieces together, you can import the Lua file as a custom dissector in Wireshark (the how-to of doing this is in a YouTube video I included in the project README), and then open the `pcapng` file generated by `tcpshark` in that Wireshark instance. If you’re a command-line buff, you can use the argument `-X lua_script:tcpshark.lua`  so the dissector gets loaded each time, and you don’t have to copy and paste it to Wireshark’s plugin folders. Both ways work. 

If everything works properly, you should be able to see `tcpshark` as a filter and also as a field in your capture:

You can also start filtering by PID, cmd and args using Wireshark’s builtin filtering system.

If you don’t load the dissector, the `pcapng` file is still perfectly usable by `tcpdump` and `wireshark` etc, it just won’t show you the extra info in a structured manner. 

## Closing thoughts

The project itself is still under development, especially ipv6 is not yet tested properly. It sits under my Github account [here](https://www.github.com/mosajjal/tcpshark). Feel free to go check it out, and as always issues and PRs are welcome.
